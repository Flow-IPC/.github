# Modern C++ toolkit for high-speed inter-process communication (IPC); plus general-purpose toolkit, Flow

Welcome!  This GitHub organization contains the Flow-IPC open-source project whose purpose is to make all your really-fast-inter-process-communication dreams come true!

There are a few repositories, but as a user you will likely care about just one (possibly two).  They are:
- [`ipc` repository](https://github.com/Flow-IPC/ipc/blob/main/README.md) - **Start here.**  As explained at that link, grab a Release tarball/zip; or clone via Git with submodules enabled.  That will get you all the code, including the other repositories involved.
- [`flow` repository](https://github.com/Flow-IPC/flow/blob/main/README.md) - Some users may be interested in this general-purpose library in and of itself.  By grabbing `ipc` you'll get this anyway; but conceivably you'd like to check it out as its own thing.

If you'd like to contribute, the first link above will surely explain how.
