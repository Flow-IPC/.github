# Modern C++ toolkit for high-speed inter-process communication (IPC)

Welcome!  The project comprises a few repositories, but as a user you will likely care about just one.  It is:
- [`ipc` repository](https://github.com/Flow-IPC/ipc/blob/main/README.md) - **Start here.**

If you'd like to contribute, the link above will surely explain how, as well.

Not sure if this is for you? Please check out the [Introduction to Flow-IPC](https://www.linode.com/blog/open-source/flow-ipc-introduction-low-latency-cpp-toolkit) blog-post. It summarizes the project and works through an example, including some performance results.
